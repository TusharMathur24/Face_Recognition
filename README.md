This project implements a Face Recognition System using Python and OpenCV. The system is capable of detecting and recognizing human faces from images or real-time video streams. It uses pre-trained machine learning models to identify faces and match them with a database of known individuals. This code can be used as a foundation for various applications such as security systems, personalized user experiences, or human-computer interaction.

Features
Real-Time Face Detection: Efficiently detect faces in real-time video streams using OpenCV.
Face Recognition: Match detected faces with a database of known individuals using pre-trained models.
Image and Video Support: Process both images and video inputs for face recognition.
Scalability: Easily scale the system by adding more faces to the recognition database.
Customizable: Modify the system to suit specific needs, such as adjusting recognition accuracy or integrating with other software.
